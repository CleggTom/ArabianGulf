Table 2A: Column descriptors for Nodes data sheet,,Column Number,Column Header,Column Description1,NodeID,The unordered nominal node specific ID number of the discrete species lifecycle stage. 2,SpeciesID,The unordered Species ID number. This is independent of Node ID number and is consistent across nodes depicting different lifecycle stages of the same species. If one wishes to combine across life stages they can substitute this number for the Node ID in analyses.3,StageID,"The ordinal Stage ID number within species. Adult lifecycle stages are designated as 1. The youngest lifecycle stage is then 2, next youngest 3, etc. Each number corresponds to a particular lifecycle stage that is consistent within a group but not between them (e.g. for trematodes 2 = rediae or sporocyst, but for dipterans 2 = larvae). Not all of a species' lifecycle stages are necessarily present in the food web."4,Stage,The unordered nominal description of the lifecycle stage code that is consistent within a particular group.5,Species.StageID,"The unique nominal numeric code for a node that combines Species ID and Stage ID, which are separated by a decimal point."6,WorkingName,"A working name for each node that is intended to be informative and useful. When available, widely used common names were employed. If no common name exists then a species name was used. If no species name was available, then a working or descriptive name was employed."7,OrganismalGroup,"A category broader than 'Working Name' primarily intended be informative, particularly in letting the user know ""what kind"" of organism a particular node is."8,NodeType,"An indication of what a particular node represents (e.g., a taxon or life-stage)."9,Resolution,"The lowest taxonomic level that a node represents (e.g. Family, Species). A species does not need to be identified to a species binomial in order to be treated as a discrete species."10,ResolutionNotes,Further information on node resolution (e.g. if a single node is suspected of being a cryptic species complex).11,Feeding,A designation as to whether a node is feeding or non-feeding. Autotrophs are considered non-feeding as are certain metazoan lifecycle stages.12,Lifestyle(stage),"An unordered enumerated description of whether a particular species' lifecycle stage is symbiotic or free-living, and if symbiotic, what type of symbiont it is. ‘Symbiosis’ is used here in the original sense of De Bary (1879), referring to all interspecific durable associations, including both parasitism and mutualism."13,Lifestyle(species),An unordered enumerated description of the fidelity a particular species has concerning interactions with other organisms. 14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),The unordered enumerated description of the general consumer strategy of a particular species lifecycle stage. It should describe the majority (usually all) of the trophic interactions of a particular consumer. 15,HabitatAffiliation,An unordered enumerated characterization of the habitat zone or type where the organism is found.16,Mobility,An ordinal enumerated characterization of the short-term vagility of the free-living nodes (excluding micropredators) in the system. 17,Residency ,An unordered enumerated characterization of the long-term vagility  of the free-living nodes (excluding micropredators) in the system.18,NativeStatus,An unordered enumerated characterization of whether or not an organism is native or non-native  to the system.19,BodySize(g),"The mean body size (grams dry weight) of an individual node. Includes hard parts, except for snails, which are soft tissue mass only."20,BodySizeEstimation,The unordered enumerated description of the method used to quantify body size.21,BodySizeNotes,Notes on the calculation the body size for a particular node in a particular system.22,BodySizeN,The number of individuals that were sampled to estimate average body size.23,Biomass(g/m^2),The average biomass per area (grams dry weight/m^2) of a particular node. Count density can be approximated from biomass and body size.24,BiomassEstimation,An unordered enumerated description of the method used to quantify the biomass of a particular node in a particular system.25,BiomassNotes,Notes concerning biomass of a particular node in a particular system.26,Kingdom,Taxonomic unit27,Phylum,Taxonomic unit28,Subphylum,Taxonomic unit29,Superclass,Taxonomic unit30,Class,Taxonomic unit31,Subclass,Taxonomic unit32,Order,Taxonomic unit33,Suborder,Taxonomic unit34,Infraorder,Taxonomic unit35,Superfamily,Taxonomic unit36,Family,Taxonomic unit37,Genus,Taxonomic unit38,SpecificEpithet,Taxonomic unit39,NodeNotes,Any general notes on the node,,,,
