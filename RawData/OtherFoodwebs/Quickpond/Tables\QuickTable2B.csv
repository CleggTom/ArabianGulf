Table 2B: Definitions of variables in the Nodes data sheet,,,Column Number,Column Header,Variable,Variable Description1,NodeID,nominal numeric,The unordered nominal node specific ID number of the discrete species lifecycle stage. 2,SpeciesID,nominal numeric,The unordered Species ID number. This is independent of Node ID number and is consistent across nodes depicting different lifecycle stages of the same species. If one wishes to combine across life stages they can substitute this number for the Node ID in analyses.3,StageID,nominal numeric,"The ordinal Stage ID number within species. Adult lifecycle stages are designated as 1. The youngest lifecycle stage is then 2, next youngest 3, etc. Each number corresponds to a particular lifecycle stage that is consistent within a group but not between them (e.g. for trematodes 2 = rediae or sporocyst, but for dipterans 2 = larvae). Not all of a species' lifecycle stages are necessarily present in the food web."4,Stage,nominal enumerated,"Note, ""adult"" includes juveniles (prereproductives) for species with no metamorphosis separating the two."5,Species.StageID,nominal numeric,"The unique nominal numeric code for a node that combines Species ID and Stage ID, which are separated by a decimal point."6,WorkingName,nominal,"A working name for each node that is intended to be informative and useful. When available, widely used common names were employed. If no common name exists then a species name was used. If no species name was available, then a working or descriptive name was employed."7,OrganismalGroup,Acanthocephala,Includes all Acanthocephala7,OrganismalGroup,Amphibia,Includes all Amphibia7,OrganismalGroup,Amphipoda,Includes all Amphipoda7,OrganismalGroup,Arachnida,Includes all Arachnida7,OrganismalGroup,Aves,Includes all Aves7,OrganismalGroup,Bacteria,Includes all Bacteria7,OrganismalGroup,Cladocera,Includes all cladocerans7,OrganismalGroup,Copepoda,Includes all Copepoda7,OrganismalGroup,Coleoptera,Includes all Coleoptera7,OrganismalGroup,Detritus,Includes all detritus7,OrganismalGroup,Diptera,Includes all Diptera 7,OrganismalGroup,Ephemeroptera,Includes all Ephemeroptera7,OrganismalGroup,Fungi,Includes all Fungi7,OrganismalGroup,Gastropoda,Includes all Gastropoda7,OrganismalGroup,Hemiptera,Includes all Hemiptera7,OrganismalGroup,Hirudinea,Includes all Hirudinea7,OrganismalGroup,Mamalia,Includes all Mammalia7,OrganismalGroup,Meiofauna,Includes all meiofauna not included in other nodes7,OrganismalGroup,Nematoda ,Includes all Nematoda7,OrganismalGroup,Odonata,Includes all odonata7,OrganismalGroup,Oligochaeta,"Includes all Oligochaeta, except Hirudinea"7,OrganismalGroup,Ostracoda,Includes all Ostracoda7,OrganismalGroup,Plant,"Includes all photosynthesizers (phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, plants, macroalgae) and parasitic plants."7,OrganismalGroup,Protista,"Includes all Protists, free-living and symbiotic"7,OrganismalGroup,Reptilia,Includes all Reptilia7,OrganismalGroup,Trematoda,Includes all Trematoda7,OrganismalGroup,Zooplankton,Includes all zooplankton not included in other nodes8,NodeType,Detritus,"The node is a non-living resource stock (e.g. carrion, nitrate)"8,NodeType,Organism Parts,"Node refers to a specific edible portion or part of an organism (e.g. the leaves, fruit or roots of a tree)."8,NodeType,Taxon,"The node is resolved to a recognized taxonomic level (generally species) but has not been broken into discrete lifecycle stages (e.g. birds, fish)."8,NodeType,Life Stage,"A species has been broken into life stages, each of which is a discrete node."8,NodeType,Functional Group,"The node is resolved to a commonly recognized ecological functional group that does not share a common taxonomic affiliation (e.g. zooplankton, meiofauna, etc.). "9,Resolution,nominal,"The lowest taxonomic level to which a Node has been identified, or an indication of whether a node represents an aggregated assemblage. A node does not have to be keyed out to a specific epithet to be treated as a discrete species. Higher taxonomic classifications denote aggregation of species in a node."10,ResolutionNotes,nominal,Any notes on node resolution (e.g. whether or not a node described as a discrete species is actually suspected of being a cryptic species assemblage).11,Feeding,Feeding,The node represents a consumer in the web.11,Feeding,Non-Feeding,"The respective node does not represent a consumer in the web. This designation applies, for instance, to detritus and non-feeding metazoan life stages (e.g. cercariae)."11,Feeding,Autotroph,The node converts simple inorganic molecules into complex organic molecules through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis.12,Lifestyle(stage),Free-Living,"The node does NOT have a symbiotic relationship with another species, but interacts with several heterospecific individuals throughout the duration of its life stage."12,Lifestyle(stage),Infectious,The node has an obligate parasitic symbiosis with another species. 12,Lifestyle(stage),Commensal,"The node has a non-trophic symbiosis with another species, usually using the host organism as habitat."12,Lifestyle(stage),Mutualist,"The node has a symbiosis with another organism where, on average the fitness of the individuals involved in the symbiosis is greater, than if each is not in the symbiotic relationship."13,Lifestyle(species),Free-Living,"The species does NOT have a symbiotic relationship with another species, but interacts with several heterospecific individuals throughout its life."13,Lifestyle(species),Infectious,The species has an obligate parasitic symbiosis with another species.13,Lifestyle(species),Commensal,"The species has a non-trophic symbiosis with another species, usually using the host organism as habitat."13,Lifestyle(species),Mutualist,"The species has a symbiosis with another organism where, on average, fitnesses of the individuals involved are greater than if each were not in the symbiotic relationship."14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Autotroph,A individual that converts simple inorganic molecules into complex organic molecules through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis.14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Predator,"A consumer individual that, within a single lifecycle stage, kills and consumes more than one individual of its prey (resource) species (e.g. snakes, warblers, clams). By killing a resource individual, the individual predator reduces the resource individual's fitness to zero in an intensity-independent manner ."14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Social Predator,"A consumer individual that cooperates with one or more conspecifics to kill and consume a single individual of the prey species (e.g. wolves, army ants). "14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Micropredator,"A consumer individual that, within a single lifecycle stage, feeds on more than one individual host resource but does not kill that resource individual. Damage to the resource is intensity-dependent, the more micropredators feeding on a resource individual the greater the resource's loss of fitness. (e.g. mosquitoes, leafhoppers, most butterfly fishes). Micropredators can be important vectors for pathogens."14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Parasitic Castrator,"A consumer individual blocks the reproduction of its individual host. Thus, while they reduce host fitness to zero, parasitic castrators do not kill their host and often do not reduce the ability of the host to survive. The effect on the host is intensity-independent, in that there is no additive reproductive effect of additional parasitic castrators on the host."14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Pathogen,"A consumer individual that infects an individual host and then multiplies within that host. Death of the host will ensue unless the infection is limited by host defensive mechanisms or external forces (e.g. other consumers). The effects are intensity-independent, as the outcome may result from a single infectious agent (or inoculum). These consumers are appropriately modeled using microparasite models (Anderson and May, 1979)(e.g. smallpox, diphtheria, malaria, lice, scale insects, Gyrodactylus spp.)."14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Macroparasite,"A consumer individual that infects an individual host, does not cause the death of its host and does not reduce the fitness of its host to zero. Also it cannot be trophically transmissible to other hosts. Impact on the host is intensity-dependent, These consumers are appropriately modeled using macroparasite models (May and Anderson, 1979) (e.g. adult cestodes, Ichthyopthirius ciliates, corn borers, whip worms, fleas and most parasitic copepods)."14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Pollinator,"A consumer individual that facilitates the fertilization of a resource individual. The consumer serially interacts with numerous resource individuals and this distinguishes it from symbiotic (durable) mutualisms. (e.g. bees, hummingbirds)."15,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Parasitoid,"A consumer individual that kills only a single host individual. Its impact on the host is intensity-independent (e.g. parasitoid wasps, bacteriophages, bruchid beetle larvae in seeds, insect iridoviruses, pasteurella viruses, nematomorphs). If the host is an adult, reproduction ceases before host death."14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Trophically Transmitted Parasitic Castrator,"An infectious consumer individual that blocks host reproduction and requires that its host to be consumed by an appropriate predator host in order to complete its lifecycle. Trophically transmitted parasitic castrators often modify host to increase trophic transmission to the predator host (e.g. Schistocephalus tapeworm pleroceroid larvae, some microphallid trematode metacercariae in molluscan hosts)."14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Trophically Transmitted Pathogen,"An infectious consumer individual that multiplies within a host and requires that the host be consumed by an appropriate predator host to complete its lifecycle. Trophically transmitted pathogens often modify host behavior to increase trophic transmission to the predator host (e.g. mulitlocular hydatid tapeworm cysts, Toxoplasma merozoites). "14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Trophically Transmitted Parasite,"An infectious consumer that to complete its life cycle requires that its host be consumed by an appropriate predator host. Its effect on the prey host is intensity-dependent. They often modify host behavior to increase trophic transmission to the predator host (e.g. most larval tapeworms, most trematode metacercariae, Guinea worms). "14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Trophically Transmitted Commensal,"The symbiont that does not have a trophic interaction with its host but in order to complete its life cycle, the symbiont requires that a predator or micropredator consume its host. In order for the trophic transmission to be successful, the predator or micropredator that consumes the symbiont's host must in turn be a viable host for the symbiont. "14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Detritivore,"A consumer individual that feeds on or breaks down dead animal and plant matter (e.g. many fungi, dung beetles, vultures)."14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Symbiotic Mutual,A symbiont with a positive interaction with its host (e.g. hermatypic corals and zooxanthellae)14,ConsumerStrategy(stage),Facultative Micropredator,"The outcome of a feeding interaction of a facultative micropredator depends on the relative size of the prey or host individual. On a large host the consumer is a micropredator, but on a small prey the consumer is a predator. The relative sizes determining feeding outcomes are system specific (e.g. vampire bats, lampreys, fang blennies). Related terms used in system and taxon-specific contexts include browser, grazer and sublethal predator."15,HabitatAffiliation,nominal,An unordered enumerated characterization of the habitat zone or type where the organism is found.16,Mobility,Low,These are organisms that generally do not leave the pond (e.g. snails)16,Mobility,Intermediate,"These are vagile individuals that move within the pond and may leave the system, but are unlikely to disperse large distances (e.g. adult hemipterans)"16,Mobility,High,"These are vagile individuals that likely move widely outside of the system, and thus have trophic links occurring outside the systems (e.g. great blue herons)"17,Residency,Resident,These are species composed of individuals whose geographic distribution does not vary appreciably throughout the year. 17,Residency,Migrant,"These are species composed of individuals that spend a substantial portion of the year in a geographic region outside of the system (e.g., those that seasonally leave to breed)."18,NativeStatus,Native,"Any organism assumed to have arrived, established and survived in the system without the direct or indirect aid of modern humans. "18,NativeStatus,Non-native,An organism that was introduced to the system as an indirect or direct result of modern human activity.19,BodySize(g),continuous numeric,"The mean body size (grams dry weight) of an individual node. Includes hard parts, except for snails, which are soft tissue mass only."20,BodySizeEstimation,Approximation,Here body size was approximated based on another node or the aggregated biomass of similar individuals. 20,BodySizeEstimation,Population,"Mean body weight reflects the local population size structure. Weights were obtained from individuals encountered during stratified random sampling. The estimate was usually based on body length measurements, which were converted to body mass using length-to-mass regressions (obtained for that species or for related or similarly shaped animals, either from the literature or from our own data). The individual mass of some parasite life stages was directly measured (e.g., trematode cercariae). For trematode infections in snails, we applied parasite to host weight ratios to the population mass-frequency distribution of infected hosts (we directly measured weight ratios for many species and gave average species estimates to other species). "20,BodySizeEstimation,Species,A single estimate for the body mass of an average individual of that species was used21,BodySizeNotes,nominal,Notes on the calculation the body size for a particular node in a particular system.22,BodySizeN,integer,The number of individuals that were sampled to estimate average body size.23,Biomass(g/m^2),continuous numeric,The average biomass per area (grams dry weight/m^2) of a particular node. Count density can be approximated from biomass and body size.24,BiomassEstimation,Quantification from sampling,Biomass density derived from quantitative sampling.25,BiomassNotes,nominal,Notes concerning biomass of a particular node in a particular system.26,Kingdom,nominal,Taxonomic unit27,Phylum,nominal,Taxonomic unit28,Subphylum,nominal,Taxonomic unit29,Superclass,nominal,Taxonomic unit30,Class,nominal,Taxonomic unit31,Subclass,nominal,Taxonomic unit32,Order,nominal,Taxonomic unit33,Suborder,nominal,Taxonomic unit34,Infraorder,nominal,Taxonomic unit35,Superfamily,nominal,Taxonomic unit36,Family,nominal,Taxonomic unit37,Genus,nominal,Taxonomic unit38,SpecificEpithet,nominal,Taxonomic unit39,NodeNotes,nominal,Any general notes on the node,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
