"Table 4: Missing, under-represented groups and severely aggregated nodes.",,,,,,,Missing groups,,,Underrepresented groups,,,Aggregated nodes,Group,Notes,,Group,Notes,,Group,NotesPlant Ectoparasites,These include herbivorous insects that would be deemed parasitic by our consumer strategy definitions.,,Meiofauna,Meiofauna were likely undersampled. ,,Phytoplankton,"This node comprises the autotrophic component of the plankton community (e.g. diatoms, dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria)."Plant Endoparasites,"Plant endoparasites such as leaf miners, nematodes, and fungus were not sampled.  ",,Endoparasites of Zooplankton,"Whle some endoparasite of zooplankton were included, they were likely undersampled (e.g., fungal parasites of zooplanton were not detected, but may be present).",,Bacteria,Free-living and symbiotic bacteria were aggregated as a single node. Bird and Mammal Ectoparasites,Bird and mammal ectoparasites such as lice and mites are undoubtedly present but were not sampled.,,Zooplankton,Zooplankton were likely undersampled.,,Benthic microalgae/periphyton,Attached microalgae and periphyton were aggregated as a single node.Free-living Protists,Free-living ciliates and flagellates are not included in the web.,,Bird and Mammal Endoparasites,"Parasites that required these hosts to complete their life cycle were included, although these hosts were likely undersampled (e.g., blood borne parasite were not sampled). ",,Vascular Plants,"This includes shoreline plants (e.g. Typhus, Scirpus, Juncus) and fully aquatic macrophytes. "Viruses,Viruses and phages were not included in the web.,,,,,,Parasites of Phytoplankton,Phytoplankton were not sampled for parasites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
