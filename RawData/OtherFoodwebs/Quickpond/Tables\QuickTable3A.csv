Table 3A: Column descriptions for Links data sheet,,Column Number,Column Name,Column Description1,ConsumerNodeID,The unordered nominal node specific ID number of the consumer in the interaction.2,ResourceNodeID,The unordered nominal node specific ID number of the resource in the interaction.3,ConsumerSpeciesID,The unordered nominal species specific ID number of the consumer in the interaction.4,ResourceSpeciesID,The unordered nominal species specific ID number of the resource in the interaction.5,ConsumerStageID,The unordered nominal stage specific ID number of the consumer in the interaction.6,ResourceStageID,The unordered nominal stage specific ID number of the resource in the interaction.7,ConsumerSpecies.StageID,"The combined Species ID number and Stage ID number of the consumer, separated by the decimal point."8,ResourceSpecies.StageID,"The combined Species ID number and Stage ID number of the resource, separated by the decimal point."9,LinkTypeID,The unordered nominal numeric indication of the specific type of trophic interaction occurring and corresponding to the Link Type column.10,LinkType,"The unordered nominal definition of a trophic interaction corresponding to the LinkTypeID column. Link types are mutually exclusive. We use the term ‘symbiont’ after De Bary (1879), to refer to all mutuals, commensals and parasites for which a larger organism serves as the single individual with which the symbiont interacts for the duration of its life or lifestage. We use 'host’ to refer to the resource individual in all symbiotic interactions and, by convention, for micropredation. We use ‘prey’ to designate resource individuals when the consumer is not a symbiont or a micropredator. Not all links are trophic (e.g. commensal) and care must be taken to exclude these from some analyses of food web structure."11,LinkEvidence,A qualitative description of the evidence or rationale for including the trophic link in the web.12,LinkEvidenceNotes,A qualitative description of the link evidence source.13,LinkFrequency,"For observed links, the proportion of times that the link was observed (e.g., the proportion of consumer guts within which the resource species was present). "14,LinkN,The number of consumers that were examined to detect this particular link.15,DietFraction,"The fraction of the consumer's diet (e.g., in terms of biomass/year) comprised by the resource node."16,ConsumptionRate,"The rate at which the interaction occurs, explicitly expressed in numbers, biomass or energy per unit time."17,VectorFrom,"The Node ID of the vector necessary for a parasitic feeding link to occur. For instance, enter the Node ID for mosquito here if the link is malaria-human. If more than one vector can lead to this type of parasitism, there will be multiple rows repeated here, one for each prey type. Note, in many cases, this will lead to duplicate links, which may need to be considered in analyses."18,PreyFrom,"The Node ID of prey needed to be consumed for a particular parasite-prey interaction to occur (via trophic transmission). If more than one prey can lead to parasitism, there will be multiple rows repeated here, one for each prey type. Note, in many cases, this will lead to duplicate links, which may need to be considered in analyses.",,,,
